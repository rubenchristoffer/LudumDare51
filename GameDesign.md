# Game Design Document


A game design document is living document which describes the intent of the game design. 
It has two goals, first to document the decisions that have been made about the game and communicate those concepts to the entire team. 
Thus, it needs to be detailed enough for programmers to refer to when they need clarification about an aspect of the game. 
It must be able to be updated as the game is to be built. 
The need to have a game design document increases with the size of the team and length of the project. 

For a student project the intent is to capture as much as possible of your design. 
The game design will be larger than what you can achieve in a semester, but you must then decide what you need to do first. 
This document should be in version control so that you can see it changing and growing. 
Given we are using git you could also use @name to assign parts of the design to individual members of the team.

### Game Options
What are the options and how do they affect gameplay and mechanics?

### Replay and Saving

### Audio, Music, Sound Effects

### Help System

## Artificial Intelligence

### Opponent and Enemy AI
The active opponent that plays against the player and therefore requires strategic decision making.

### Non-combat and Friendly Characters

### Support AI

### Player and Collision Detection, Path-finding.
