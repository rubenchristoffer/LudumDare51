# LudumDare 51
Our submition to the 51st Ludum Dare game jam!

It's a proceduraly generated "dungeon crawler" where you try to expand your tiles to find the exit. 

## Every 10 seconds
The theme was "Every 10 seconds", our idea on an implementation for this is to continuesly make events happen every 10 seconds.
This is not very apparent to the player yet is a significant impact on the gameloop.

## Assets etc.
All assets are made by us, with the exception of sounds, they are generated with a randomizer found online.
